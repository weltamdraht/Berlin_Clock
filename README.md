## Why another Berlin-Clock?
1. This one ***calculates*** which digits are lit and which are not instead of unelegantly putting every possible state of the clock in arrays.
2. This setup elegantly uses Texas Instruments' [SN74HC595](https://www.ti.com/product/SN74HC595) shift registers instead of an Arduino with more GPIOs.
